# Detecting-Anomalies-from-transactions-using-ML

This project builds an end-to-end workflow to detect atypical or potentially fraudulent transactions without labels. It cleans and encodes data, engineers time- and behavior-based features, trains an Isolation Forest model, and surfaces a ranked anomalies table with simple visuals for fast triage.
